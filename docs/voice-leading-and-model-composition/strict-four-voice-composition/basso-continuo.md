# Composing in basso-continuo style

_Basso continuo_ (It. for "continuous bass" or "thoroughbass") is essentially a chordal version of first-species counterpoint. However, instead of composing a single line above a cantus firmus, one composes a succession of chords (performed in the right hand) above a bass line (performed in the left hand). _Basso continuo_ writing, also referred to as _realizing a figured bass_, gives no consideration to melody, only to the use of proper chords and the smoothest voice-leading possible. Thus, _basso continuo_ style is a simple place to begin engaging the "fundamental musical problems" that arise when more than two lines are combined.

## Chord voicing

In strict keyboard-style writing, there are four voices: the bass line (which is usually a given in _basso continuo_ style), and three _upper voices_: the _melody_ or _soprano_, the _alto_, and the _tenor_ (from highest to lowest). Since all three upper voices must be played by a single hand, they should never span more than an octave.

The melody always has an upward-pointing stem. Alto and tenor share a downward-pointing stem. If the alto and tenor share a note, that note receives a single downward-pointing stem. (See m. 1 of the example below.) If melody and alto share a note, that notehead is double-stemmed. (See m. 4 of the example below.)

When choosing the notes to place in the upper voices above a figured bass, use the bass and figures to determine the pitch classes present in the chord. (When realizing an _unfigured bass_, you must determine appropriate figures before realizing.) If the chord is a four-note chord, use each chord member once, including the bass (exceptions will be noted later). If a chord has three pitch-classes (a triad, for instance), use each pitch-class once, and "double" one of them according to the following principles:

- If the figure is 6/4, 5/3, or other chord of the fifth, double the bass pitch class.
- If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a _fixed scale degree_ (_do_, _re_, _fa_, or _sol_), double the bass pitch class.
- If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a _variable scale degree_ (_mi_/_me_, _la_/_le_, or _ti_/_te_) or a chromatically altered pitch, double one of the upper voices at the octave or unison.
- Generally, do not double a variable scale degree or a chromatically altered pitch.

In _basso continuo_ style, if the chord is properly voiced (correct pitch classes and correct doublings), two key principles of voice-leading will ensure good counterpoint between the voices most of the time:

- _The law of the shortest way_ (a term coined by composer Arnold Schoenberg): move each voice as little as possible. Prefer repetition to steps, steps to leaps, and one leap at a time to several voices leaping at the same time.
- _Move the right hand in contrary or oblique motion to the bass._ When the bass leaps by fourth or fifth, though, this rule can be ignored.

In some cases, these rules cannot be followed absolutely (such as when a functional dissonance must be resolved, or when a melody makes it impossible—two cases to be considered later). In all cases, observe the following:

- No parallel fifths or octaves between any pair of voices.
- No contrary fifths or octaves between outer voices.
- Do not approach an octave between the outer voices by similar motion unless the melody moves by step. (All other direct/hidden fifths and octaves are permissible.)

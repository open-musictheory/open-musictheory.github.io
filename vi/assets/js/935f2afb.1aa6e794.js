Voice-leading deals with the relationship of two or more musical lines (or melodies) combined into a single musical idea. Harmony addresses the rules or norms for combining chords into successions. Form addresses the rules or norms for the combination of phrases and other small musical units into larger units\u2014including whole movements and works.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/basso-continuo":{"id":"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/basso-continuo","title":"Composing in basso-continuo style","description":"Basso continuo (It. for \\"continuous bass\\" or \\"thoroughbass\\") is essentially a chordal version of first-species counterpoint. However, instead of composing a single line above a cantus firmus, one composes a succession of chords (performed in the right hand) above a bass line (performed in the left hand). Basso continuo writing, also referred to as realizing a figured bass, gives no consideration to melody, only to the use of proper chords and the smoothest voice-leading possible. Thus, basso continuo style is a simple place to begin engaging the \\"fundamental musical problems\\" that arise when more than two lines are combined.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/basso-continuo-history":{"id":"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/basso-continuo-history","title":"A brief history of basso continuo keyboard-style voice-leading","description":"Basso continuo emerged in the seventeenth century as a shorthand notation for keyboardists (typically church organists) who were accompanying a soloist or small ensemble performing a work originally composed for a larger group. For example, if two or three singers were tasked with performing an eight-voice choral work, they could select the most prominent parts to sing, while an organist could cover the rest. Performing five or six lines of contrapuntal choral music could be a significant challenge, so organists needed a way to condense the texture while still preserving the core musical structure to support the vocalists.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/embellishingTones":{"id":"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/embellishingTones","title":"Embellishing tones","description":"Passing Tone (PT)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/generating-roman-numerals-from-a-figured-bass-line":{"id":"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/generating-roman-numerals-from-a-figured-bass-line","title":"Generating Roman numerals from a figured bass line","description":"Both bass lines and root progressions are important for the study and mastery of tonal harmony.

Laws are characteristics of music that are based on human biology and psychology, and as a result laws are more-or-less universal. Rules are culturally conditioned. They are hallmarks of a particular style that are more-or-less universal within the style, but differ from style to style and culture to culture. Finally, strategies are specific ways in which composers work within a style \u2014 the things that make one composer\'s work sound different from another\'s, even if they compose in the same style.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/tendency-tones-functional-dissonances":{"id":"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/tendency-tones-functional-dissonances","title":"Tendency tones and functional harmonic dissonances","description":"In strict keyboard style, there are two main types of pitch tendency to keep in mind: tendency tones and functional dissonances.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/thorough-bass-figures":{"id":"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-four-voice-composition/thorough-bass-figures","title":"Introduction to thoroughbass","description":"A thoroughbass (It.

Further, and most importantly, we combine these melodies to create a whole texture that is smooth, exhibits variety and goal-oriented motion, and in which these melodies both maintain their independence and fuse together into consonant simultaneities (the general term for two or more notes sounding at the same time).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-two-voice-composition-species-counterpoint/fourth-species":{"id":"voice-leading-and-model-composition/strict-two-voice-composition-species-counterpoint/fourth-species","title":"Composing a fourth-species counterpoint","description":"In fourth-species counterpoint, the counterpoint line and cantus firmus both move once per bar, but they are rhythmically offset from each other by a half note.
